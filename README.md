# Python-EDA-Student-Performance-Dataset


### 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python on the Student Performance dataset.  
The objective is to analyze data distribution, detect outliers using the IQR method, study correlations, and export a cleaned dataset.

### 🔍 EDA Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset and checked shape, info, and head  
2. Generated descriptive statistics  
3. Calculated missing value percentage  
4. Visualized data using histograms and boxplots  
5. Detected outliers using IQR method  
6. Created outlier flag columns  
7. Handled outliers using capping method  
8. Created correlation matrix  
9. Exported cleaned dataset
